# Python control flow projects for beginners
Python exercises for Conditional statements, Match case statements, Loops and Nested loops.


# List of projects
'weather_advise.py': A Weather Recommendation Program that asks the user about the current weather conditions and provides clothing recommendations based on the input. This exercise aims to demonstrate the use of if, elif, and else statements to make decisions in a program.

'match_case_calculator.py': A Simple Calculator with Match Case that prompts the user to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). The script will then perform the selected operation using a Match Case statement and display the result.

'multiplication_table.py': A Multiplication Table Generator that asks the user to enter a number, then use a for loop to print the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.

'pattern_drawing.py': A Drawing Patterns with Nested Loops that prompts the user to enter a positive integer, then use nested loops to print a square pattern of that size made of asterisks (*).

'daily_reminder.py': A Personal Daily Reminder that asks the user for a single task, its priority level, and if it is time-sensitive. The program will then provide a customized reminder for that task, demonstrating control flow and loops without relying on data structures to store multiple tasks.


# How to run
```bash
python weather_advise.py

# Requirements: Python 3.x.
